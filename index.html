<h3>Here are a few websites I like:</h3> <br>
<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">Homestar Runner </a><br>
<a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a><br>
<a href="http://www.nashvillepredators.com">Nashville Predators</a><br>
<br>
<h3> And <a href="https://chrismellor08.github.io/Blog/">here</a> is a link to my lovely blog, with lots of interesting insights into my experiences thus far at NSS. </h3><br>
<p> I am aware that this is supposed to be a section containing the actual blog posts, but the site I made for my blog looks way cooler and I don't feel like styling them again on here. Rest assured- I am very aware of how to use an article tag and stick things into them.
